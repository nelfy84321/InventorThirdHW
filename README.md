## About
The application is completely front-end. A fake server was created  on base of "jsonplaceholder.typicode" to store the database and send JSON requests. The app displays a list of movies that you can add to your own basket. Local storage is used to store a list of movies that has been added to the basket.

This project is designed by ASOS.com (you can see an example in the exp.jpg file). You can add a movie to your cart by clicking on the "+" icon next to each movie.
Click on the basket icon to see the content of your basket. You can delete every movie one by one or clear the basket completely using the buttons 'delete' and 'clear the basket'.
The content of the basket is updated by using rxjs requests.
